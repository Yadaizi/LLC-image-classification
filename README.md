# LLC-image-classification
Implemented the entire process of a supervised image classification algorithm in Python, which enhanced the Spatial Pyramid Matching method by using locality-constrained linear coding in the encoding step
### To run the code:
1. Put Caltech101 image dataset in the image directory and rename the folder with "Caltech101" .
2. Download the scikit-learn package for linear SVM.
3. Use Prof. Lazebnik's matlab codes for SIFT descriptor extraction and put result in features directory.
4. Start LLC_Test.py  


To train the codebook, one can simply use K-means. A pre-trained codebook is included in the package for Caltech101.
